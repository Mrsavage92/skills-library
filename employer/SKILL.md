## Routing Logic

### Full Employer Brand Audit (`/employer audit <company>`)
Flagship command. Analyses all public employer brand touchpoints:

1. Careers page quality and conversion
2. Review reputation (Glassdoor, Indeed, Seek, Google)
3. LinkedIn company presence
4. Employee Value Proposition clarity
5. Job posting quality
6. Social employer brand content

**Scoring Methodology (Employer Brand Score 0-100):**
| Category | Weight | What It Measures |
|---|---|---|
| Review Reputation | 25% | Glassdoor/Indeed/Seek ratings, volume, sentiment, response management |
| Careers Page Quality | 25% | Design, content, EVP, team photos, benefits, conversion flow |
| EVP & Messaging | 15% | Value proposition clarity, consistency, differentiation from competitors |
| LinkedIn Presence | 15% | Company page quality, follower count, content cadence, employee advocacy |
| Job Posting Quality | 10% | Title clarity, description quality, salary transparency, inclusivity signals |
| Social & Content | 10% | Employer brand content, behind-the-scenes, culture storytelling |

### Quick Snapshot (`/employer quick <company>`)
Fast 60-second assessment. Do NOT use sub-skills. Instead:
1. Search for the company on Glassdoor/Indeed
2. Check their careers page and LinkedIn
3. Score: review rating, careers page quality, EVP clarity, LinkedIn presence, job posting quality
4. Output a quick scorecard with top 3 wins and top 3 fixes
5. Keep output under 30 lines

### Individual Commands
For `/employer careers`, `/employer reviews`, etc., route to the corresponding sub-skill.

## Business Context Detection

Before running any analysis, detect the employer type:
- **Enterprise (1000+)** - Focus on: employer brand consistency, Glassdoor management, EVP differentiation, campus recruiting signals
- **Mid-Market (100-999)** - Focus on: careers page quality, review volume building, LinkedIn presence, hiring velocity
- **SMB/Startup (10-99)** - Focus on: founder brand as employer brand, culture storytelling, careers page basics, job board presence
- **Agency/Consultancy** - Focus on: team page, project showcase, culture differentiation, LinkedIn employee advocacy

## Output Standards

1. **Evidence-based** - Every score backed by quoted data from public sources
2. **Benchmarked** - Compare against industry averages and direct competitors
3. **Actionable** - Every recommendation specific enough to implement
4. **Buyer-ready** - Reports presentable to a Head of People without editing
5. **Fear-first** - Lead with what they're losing (candidates, hires, reputation)

## Key Statistics for Framing

Use these in executive summaries and recommendations:
- 87% of job seekers won't apply to a company with negative reviews (Glassdoor)
- 83% of candidates research reviews before deciding where to apply (Glassdoor 2026)
- 51% of talent leaders increasing employer brand investment in 2026 (BuiltIn)
- Strong employer brands see 50% more qualified applicants and 28% lower turnover (LinkedIn)
- Companies with strong employer brands spend 43% less per hire (LinkedIn)
- 70% of Glassdoor users more likely to apply if employer actively responds to reviews
- Work-life balance has overtaken pay as top global motivator (83% vs 82%) (Randstad 2026)

## Cross-Skill Integration

- If `EMPLOYER-BRAND-AUDIT.md` exists, `/employer report-pdf` uses it
- `/employer evp` benefits from `/employer reviews` data if available
- After audit, suggest follow-ups: `/employer careers`, `/employer reviews`, `/employer report-pdf`
