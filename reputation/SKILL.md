| Google Business Profile | 25% | Rating, review count, response rate, photo count, completeness |
| Industry Review Platforms | 25% | TripAdvisor/OpenTable/Trustpilot/ProductReview ratings and volume |
| Social Media Reputation | 15% | Facebook recommendations, social mentions, sentiment |
| Review Response Management | 15% | Response rate, speed, quality, tone across all platforms |
| Review Velocity & Trend | 10% | Are reviews increasing or stagnating? Rating trend over time |
| Competitive Reputation Position | 10% | How ratings compare to direct competitors |

## Data Gathering Method

For every audit, search the web for the business across:
- Google Business Profile (search `[business name] [location]`)
- TripAdvisor (search `[business name] TripAdvisor`)
- OpenTable (for restaurants/hospitality)
- Trustpilot, ProductReview.com.au (for products/services)
- Facebook page recommendations
- Yelp (primarily US but some AU presence)
- Industry-specific platforms (RealEstate.com.au for agents, Whirlpool for ISPs, etc.)
- Google search: `[business name] reviews`

## Output Standards

1. **Platform-by-platform data** - Exact ratings, review counts, response rates per platform
2. **Sentiment analysis** - Common positive and negative themes across all reviews
3. **Response audit** - How (or if) they respond, with quality assessment
4. **Competitive benchmarking** - How they compare to 2-3 direct competitors
5. **Fear-first framing** - Lead with reputation risks and lost revenue

## Key Statistics for Framing

- 93% of consumers say online reviews impact their purchasing decisions (Podium)
- Businesses with 4.0+ stars earn 28% more revenue than those below 4.0 (Harvard Business Review)
- 53% of customers expect a response to negative reviews within a week (ReviewTrackers)
- A half-star improvement on Yelp leads to a 5-9% increase in revenue (Harvard)
- 73% of consumers only pay attention to reviews written in the last month (BrightLocal)
- Businesses that respond to reviews earn 35% more revenue than those that don't (Womply)

## Cross-Skill Integration

- If `REPUTATION-AUDIT.md` exists, `reputation report-pdf` uses it
- Pairs with `market audit` (reputation directly feeds Brand & Trust scoring)
- Pairs with `employer audit` (customer reviews affect employer brand perception)
- After audit, suggest: `reputation response`, `reputation monitor`, `reputation report-pdf`
