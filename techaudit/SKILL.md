## Scoring Methodology (Technical Health Score 0-100)

| Category | Weight | What It Measures |
|---|---|---|
| Page Speed & Performance | 25% | Load times, Core Web Vitals signals, asset optimisation, server response |
| Mobile Responsiveness | 20% | Viewport config, touch targets, responsive layout, mobile UX |
| SEO Technical Health | 20% | Title/meta tags, schema markup, canonical URLs, sitemap, robots.txt, header hierarchy |
| Security & SSL | 15% | HTTPS, SSL config, mixed content, security headers |
| Accessibility | 10% | Alt text, colour contrast, ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, heading structure |
| Code Quality & Standards | 10% | Valid HTML, CSS errors, broken links, console errors, deprecated elements |

## Data Gathering Method

For every audit, use `web_fetch` to retrieve the target URL. From the HTML source, extract and analyse:

**Page speed signals:** Image formats (WebP vs PNG/JPG), lazy loading, minified CSS/JS, number of HTTP requests (script/link tags), render-blocking resources, font loading strategy

**Mobile signals:** Viewport meta tag, responsive CSS (media queries), touch-friendly elements, font sizes, tap target spacing

**SEO technical:** Title tag, meta description, canonical URL, robots meta, schema/JSON-LD, Open Graph tags, header hierarchy (H1-H6), sitemap.xml, robots.txt

**Security:** HTTPS, mixed content (http:// resources on https:// page), security-related meta tags, Content-Security-Policy signals

**Accessibility:** Image alt text coverage, heading structure, ARIA attributes, form labels, colour contrast indicators, skip navigation links

**Code quality:** HTML validation issues, deprecated tags, inline styles prevalence, broken links, console error indicators

## Output Standards

1. **Evidence-based** - Every score backed by specific findings from the HTML source
2. **Actionable** - Every recommendation includes what to fix, where, and how
3. **Prioritised by impact** - Critical issues (breaking the site) before nice-to-haves
4. **Non-technical language** - Explain issues in terms of business impact, not just technical jargon
5. **Tool-specific** - Recommend specific tools and services where applicable

## Key Statistics for Framing

- 53% of mobile users abandon sites that take longer than 3 seconds to load (Google)
- A 1-second delay in page load reduces conversions by 7% (Akamai)
- 96.3% of websites have WCAG 2 accessibility failures (WebAIM 2024)
- Google uses Core Web Vitals as a ranking factor - poor scores directly hurt SEO
- 61% of users won't return to a mobile site they had trouble accessing (Google)
- HTTPS is a confirmed Google ranking signal since 2014

## Cross-Skill Integration

- If `TECHNICAL-AUDIT.md` exists, `techaudit report-pdf` uses it
- Pairs with `market audit` (technical issues affect marketing effectiveness)
- Pairs with `market-seo` (overlapping SEO technical signals)
- After audit, suggest follow-ups: `techaudit speed`, `techaudit accessibility`, `techaudit report-pdf`
